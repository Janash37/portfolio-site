    <p>A bit of information about who I am:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>31, living in Surrey</li>
        <li>One dog, a Cocker Spaniel called Doug</li>
        <li>Degree in German language and History</li>
        <li>Mad about Viking reenactment and a member of The Vikings! UK reenactment society</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So why did I decide to get into software development?</p>
    <p>After 8 years working in sales I decided it was time for a change. The Coronavirus pandemic forced me to look at what my future career would look like and, while looking at other options, I realised that I am actuall half-decent (so far) at programming!</p>
